// In a real implementation, you would:
// - Upgrade the connection to a WebSocket
// - Authenticate the user (if needed)
// - For commentators: accept audio chunks with game time and broadcast to listeners
// - For listeners: accept a game time and stream audio chunks from that point
// - Store audio chunks in memory or a fast store (e.g., Redis) for real-time access
